# Agent_Model_1

This is a agent based model. This model simulates agents, moving around a environment from either set starting point downloaded from xxx 
or random starting points. The Agents then move around the environment 'nibbling' at it and then storing this in the stores. The Agents are able
to share resources dependent on the location and how much they all ready have stored. The Resulting model is displayed on a GUI and a text file called 
'Agents' allocated each Agent a ID and shows the location 'x' and 'y' coordiantes and the amount of environment in there store. 

# # How to Run the Model:
1) Download all the files into the same folder
2) Open a command window in the same file 
3) Type: python model.py -h  This will show you the atributs you need to define: Number of Agents, number of Wolfs, Number of iterations and Size of Environment 
4) Type: python model.py x x x x       and press enter (where X is the the values you want to select) 
5) A GUI will appear, press run, then run model
6) The Model will now run in the GUI and 'Agent' text file will be written and available in the folder.
